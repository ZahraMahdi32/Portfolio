## 1. Purpose of Using AI  
AI tools (specifically ChatGPT) were used to support the development of the portfolio by helping with:  
- Debugging JavaScript errors.  
- Improving UI/UX ideas and color theme suggestions.  
- Writing clean explanations for documentation sections.  
- Generating structure for modal components and GitHub API fetch logic.  

AI was not used to generate complete files automatically.  
All final coding, structure, styling, and logic were manually verified, edited, and integrated by me.

## 2. Specific Interactions  
Here are examples of tasks supported by AI:  
- Fixing EmailJS validation and status message errors.  
- Helping implement dark/light theme toggling.  
- Assisting with modal UI responsiveness.  
- Suggesting improvements for the demo presentation and script.

## 3. Student Verification  
All AI-generated parts were reviewed, modified, and integrated manually.  
The student confirms that they understand all code used and can explain every feature including:  
- GitHub REST API usage  
- EmailJS integration  
- DOM manipulation logic  
- CSS theming system

## 4. Ethical & Academic Considerations  
AI assistance followed KFUPM guidelines:  
- AI was used as a helper, not as a code generator for full solutions.  
- The final implementation reflects my own work and understanding.

## **Conclusion**  
AI assisted in brainstorming, debugging, and documentation, but the portfolio's implementation, design, and logic were built and finalized by me.

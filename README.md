# Assignment 4 – Personal Portfolio Web Application

This repository contains my final personal portfolio web application for **Assignment 4**.  
It is a polished, responsive, and documented project that demonstrates the main concepts of the course:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API integration, state management, AI-assisted development, and professional documentation.

## 🔍 Overview

The application is a single-page portfolio website that includes:

- A hero section with a personalized greeting.
- An "About Me" section describing my background and interests.
- A "Skills" section listing my technical skills.
- A "Featured Projects" section highlighting key course-related projects.
- An API-powered "Latest GitHub Repositories" section using the GitHub REST API.
- A "Contact Me" section with client-side form validation.
- A dark/light theme toggle stored in `localStorage`.
- A back-to-top button (creative feature) for better user experience.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and semantic layout.
- **CSS3** – Styling, cards, responsive layout, and light/dark modes.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM manipulation, localStorage, form validation, and API calls.
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and public repository.
- **GitHub Pages** – Deployment and live hosting.
- **AI Tools** – ChatGPT for planning, code suggestions, and documentation assistance.
